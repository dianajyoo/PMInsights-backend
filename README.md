# PM Insights

Analyzes and displays your sleep data using your Fitbit device (similar to the Fitbit app). Requires a Fitbit account in order to log in and gain consent to access your data. Using Recharts node package, it will display a pie chart and line graph with a breakdown of total minutes spent in the light, wake, rem, and deep cycles as well as sleep duration and resting heart rate for a specific night of rest. Additional feature includes adding, editing, and deleting your sleep goals.    

This is the backend and the frontend with instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/dianajyoo/PMInsights-frontend).
